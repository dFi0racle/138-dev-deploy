## Overview
This document outlines the strategy for migrating to the new CCIP-based bridge infrastructure while maintaining support for high-volume transfers and market data reporting.

## Key Requirements
1. Support >50% of digital currency transport

3. Integrate with listing sites (CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, GeckoTerminal)
4. Follow OpenZeppelin Defender best practices

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Day 1-2)
1. Deploy CCIP Router contracts on all networks
2. Set up Defender Relayers and Autotasks
3. Configure monitoring and alerting
4. Verify contract deployments

### Phase 2: Bridge Deployment (Day 3-4)
1. Deploy CCIPBridge contracts with read-only mode
2. Deploy Reporter contracts
3. Set up cross-chain message routes
4. Configure token allowlists

### Phase 3: Market Data Integration (Day 5-6)
1. Implement listing site APIs
2. Set up data reporting flows
3. Configure automated market data updates
4. Verify data consistency

### Phase 4: Gradual Migration (Day 7-14)
1. Enable new bridge in read-only mode
2. Begin parallel operation with existing bridge
3. Gradually increase transfer limits
4. Monitor performance and security

### Phase 5: Full Transition (Day 15-21)
1. Migrate existing liquidity
2. Switch to new bridge as primary
3. Maintain old bridge for withdrawals only
4. Complete transition verification
